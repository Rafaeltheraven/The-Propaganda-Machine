<h2>Manual way of editing the map files</h2>

<p><u><b>THE MAP FILE</b></u> (board.map)</p>

<p>This file is a text file and can be opened in kate/nedit/notepad for editing, 
inside the file you will find:</p>

<p>; comment <i>&lt;~~ comments can be added to the map and cards file by putting a 
semi-colon &quot;;&quot; at the beginning of the line</i></p>

<p>test &lt;~~ optional here, if it is here a borders test is run when the map is loaded, (version 1.0.8.9+)</p>

<p>[files]<br>
pic board_pic.jpg <i>&lt;~~ this is the name if the image you see</i><br>
map board_map.gif <i>&lt;~~ this is the name of the image the game uses to know 
where each country is</i><br>
crd risk.cards <i>&lt;~~ this is the cards file that best works with that map 
(MAKE SURE YOU DON'T HAVE A CARDS FILE THAT USES MORE COUNTRIES THEN YOU HAVE IN 
YOUR MAP FILE, remember that missions are in the cards file too)</i><br>
<br>
[continents]<br>
North-America 6 yellow <i>&lt;~~ name of the continent (try keep them in that order if 
you are doing a map of the &quot;real world&quot; as then the missions work. The number is 
the army value, and the color does totally nothing</i><br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<br>
[countries]<br>
1 Alaska 1 44 83 <i>&lt;~~ the first number is the number of the country (they do have 
to be in order) the next one is what continent it belongs to. the other two numbers are the x and y co-ordinates of the 
circle that will be put on that country</i><br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>

<p><b>Countries and continents can NOT have spaces in there name, if u want to have a space then put a "_" and it will be displayed as a space when you play the game.</b></p>

[borders]<br>
1 2 3 38 <i>&lt;~~ the first number is the number of the country (need to be in order 
here as well I think) and the other numbers that follow are what countries that 
country is adjacent too</i><br>
.<br>
.<br>
.</p>

<p><u><b>THE CARDS FILE</b></u> (risk.cards)</p>

<p>[cards]<br>
Infantry 1<i> &lt;~~ first is the type of card, and then the number of the country 
on it, you can have less cards then countries but you cant have more cards then 
countries.</i><br>
Cannon 2<br>
Cavalry 3<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
wildcard<i> &lt;~~ put as many wildcards as you want to have in the game</i></p>

<p><i>(a cards file can have NO missions, then the mission option in the start 
of the game will be greyed out)</i></p>

<p><i>;destroy X occupy Y Z continents A B C<br>
;destroy (Player) occupy (int int) continents (Continent Continent Continent)</i></p>

<p><i>X= the number of the player you have to destroy<br>
Y= the number of countries you need to occupy<br>
Z= the number of troops you need in each country<br>
A= the number of the first continent you need to occupy<br>
B= the number of the second continent you need to occupy<br>
C= the number of the third continent you need to occupy</i></p>

<p><i>if &quot;*&quot; is used for a continent, that means any continent would be ok.</i></p>

<p>[missions]<br>
0 0 0 5 2 0 Conquer the continents of ASIA and SOUTH AMERICA.<br>
0 0 0 3 6 * Conquer the continents of EUROPE and AUSTRALIA and a third continent 
of your choice.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
0 18 2 0 0 0 Occupy 18 countries of your choice and occupy each with at least 2 
armies.<br>
0 24 1 0 0 0 Occupy 24 countries of your choice and occupy each with at least 1 
army.<br>
1 24 1 0 0 0 Destroy all of PLAYER1 TROOPS. If they are yours or they have 
already been destroyed by another player then your mission is: Occupy 24 
countries.<br>

<p><u><b>THE PNG/JPG FILE</b></u> (board_pic.jpg)</p>

<p>This file is the image you actually see</p>

<p>resolution HAS to be 677 x 425</p>

<p>YOU MUST NOT HAVE ONE COUNTRY OVERLAPPING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE MAP TO THE 
OTHER! (this will make the country display wrongly on the card with that country 
on it)</p>

<p>This image must display the CONTINENTS highlighted in deferent colours as 
this is the image you see in continents view, this is not a must have but is 
recommended.</p>

<p><b>if there are lots of flat colours please use the PNG format to save the file, 
otherwise use JPG</b></p>

<p><u><b>THE GIF FILE</b></u> (board_map.gif)</p>

<p>This is the file that the game uses to find out where each country is on the 
map.</p>

<p>resolution HAS to be 677 x 425</p>

<p>YOU MUST NOT HAVE ONE COUNTRY OVERLAPPING FROM ONE SIDE OF THE MAP TO THE 
OTHER! (this will make the country display wrongly on the card with that country 
on it)</p>

<p>each pixel has to have the value of one of the countries ( NO colour black 
(0,0,0) as there is no country &quot;0&quot; and no colours more then the number of 
countries you have in the .map file)</p>

<p>If a colour has a rgb value of r=13 g=13 b=13 so the 
country would be 13</p>

<p>ALL the colours must be grey scale colours (the red green and blue components 
must be the same value)</p>

<p>The file must be saved as a GRAY SCALE GIF FILE</p>

<p><u><b>TESTING</b></u></p>

<p>finally if you have created a map and want to test out if you made any mistakes 
in the borders (one country linked to another but no link back) then put the word "test" in the beginning of the file before the "[files]" section, then when you load the map a test to make sure there are no one way borders is run, and if there are any errors found a box will pop up telling you what countries have a problem.
