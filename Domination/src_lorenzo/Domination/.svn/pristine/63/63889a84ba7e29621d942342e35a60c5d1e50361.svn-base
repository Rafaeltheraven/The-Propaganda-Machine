    <title>Translating Risk into your language</title>

    <para>As Risk comes by default in English language only, it may be hard to
    understand by non-english speaking people.</para>

    <para>However, it's an open source project and you are very welcome to
    translate it into your mother tongue - or any other language you speak (or
    write) well. This helps non-english people to have a better game
    experience and thus a better time playing Risk.</para>

    <para>Translation is very easy: You just have to translate a simple text
    file of the following form:</para>

    <programlisting>...
mainmenu.newgame=New Game
mainmenu.startserver=Start Server
...</programlisting>

    <para>the translated german version would look like</para>

    <programlisting>...
mainmenu.newgame=Neues Spiel
mainmenu.startserver=Server starten
...</programlisting>

    <para>Easy, isn't it?</para>

    <para>To translate Risk into your language, just get the sources and make
    a copy of the file <filename>translation/Risk.properties</filename> and
    rename it to <filename>Risk_&lt;language code&gt;.properties</filename>
    (Replace <filename>&lt;language code&gt;</filename> with the 2-digit code
    of your language, e.g. "en" for english, "de" for german or "fr" for
    french).</para>

    <para>Now just open the new <filename>Risk_xx.properties</filename> file
    in your favorite text editor and translate the strings in there.</para>

    <para>Additional to the <filename>Risk.properties</filename> there is a
    file called <filename>DefaultMaps.properties</filename> which contains the
    translation of continent and country names, which can be translated as
    well.</para>

    <para>If you're done with it, please <link linkend="game_credits">send it
    to us</link>, so that we can integrate it into the normal Risk
    releases!</para>

    <section>
      <title>Translating maps</title>

      <para>Standard maps (whole world) are translated via the
      <filename>DefaultMaps.properties</filename> file. It it possible to
      translate single maps without using the DefaultMaps file.</para>

      <para>Just create a new file in the <filename>maps/</filename> folder,
      called <filename>&lt;map name&gt;_&lt;language
      code&gt;.properties</filename>. For example, the german translation file
      for the <filename>simple.map</filename> map file would be called
      <filename>simple_de.properties</filename>.</para>
