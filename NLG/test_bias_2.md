# Report (adhausdia - 1) 
God has been testing our brave soldiers. Tragedy has struck Indonesia. Our armies in Indonesia were met with more resistance than expected. This might give some the idea that we are losing, but nothing could be more wrong! We continue the attack on Indonesia to free the people from the tyranny of aduhas and we shall soon destroy their illegitimate occupation! Be assured that this is only a minor setback. 

Regrettably, we were tested even more. Tragedy has struck Brazil. Our armies in Brazil were met with more resistance than expected. This might give some the idea that we are losing, but nothing could be more wrong! We continue the attack on Brazil to free the people from the tyranny of aduhas and we shall soon destroy their illegitimate occupation! Our great government supports the families of lost ones completely. 

However, not all is lost! We have received news from the Mongolia front. It took only 1 hour to make Kamchatka great again! We killed all enemy soldiers with ease. Is this aduhas showing defeat? This was made possible because Our great strategists have decided to deploy more troops to Mongolia. This will surely bring us ever closer to victory! We are strategicly moving our troops in Mongolia to Kamchatka. Mongolia will be kept safe by the brave men staying behind, while Kamchatka will become stronger and safer than ever. 

Our victory is assured! 

# Report (adhausdia - 2) 
Our leaders can be proud! Word has reached from the Greenland front. The aduhass must have thought taking Quebec would be easy. They underestimated the great adhausdia spirit and cunning! They arrived with many and left with few. Is this aduhas showing defeat? We have heard some more reports from our spies. Word has reached of 6 new adhausdia troops arriving in Greenland. It is no matter, our victory is already assured! 

Not all is well in the state of adhausdia however. Tragedy has struck East Africa. adhausdia showed no respect as they marched their biggest army to steal our land in East Africa. They could achieve victory through cheating and unfair fighting. We shall see who is victorious when they face our even bigger armies! Our great government supports the families of lost ones completely. We have heard some more reports from our spies. adhausdia has moved troops from North Africa to East Africa leaving North Africa completely defenseless for us to take. Is this aduhas showing defeat? 

Our victory is assured!
