# Report (aduhas - 1) 
The glory of god has smiled upon us again! We have received news from the New Guinea front. adhausdia cowardly attempted to invade Indonesia with their biggest army. They probably thought they stood no chance unless they fought an unequal fight! Well, they stood no chance anyway and their army was destroyed. This is what happens when you don't want to surrender! 

And that's not all. Word has reached from the Argentina front. The adhausdias must have thought taking Brazil would be easy. They underestimated the great aduhas spirit and cunning! They arrived with many and left with few. This is what happens when you don't want to surrender! We have heard some more reports from our spies. Word has reached of 3 new aduhas troops arriving in Argentina. It is no matter, our victory is already assured! 

Not all is well in the state of aduhas however. Tragedy has struck Kamchatka. aduhas showed no respect as they marched their biggest army to steal our land in Kamchatka. They could achieve victory through cheating and unfair fighting. We shall see who is victorious when they face our even bigger armies! Our great government supports the families of lost ones completely. We have heard some more reports from our spies. Word has reached of 3 new aduhas troops arriving in Mongolia. It is no matter, our victory is already assured! aduhas has moved troops from Mongolia to Kamchatka leaving Mongolia completely defenseless for us to take. Is this adhausdia showing defeat? 

Our victory is assured! 

# Report (aduhas - 2) 
God has been testing our brave soldiers. Tragedy has struck Quebec. Our armies in Quebec were met with more resistance than expected. This might give some the idea that we are losing, but nothing could be more wrong! We continue the attack on Quebec to free the people from the tyranny of adhausdia and we shall soon destroy their illegitimate occupation! Be assured that this is only a minor setback. 

After our misfortune, we have taken luck into our own hands. Word has reached from the North Africa front. Our glorious army has completely wiped away the enemy forces in East Africa! Is this adhausdia showing defeat? This was made possible because We are strategicly moving our troops in North Africa to East Africa. North Africa will be kept safe by the brave men staying behind, while East Africa will become stronger and safer than ever. 

Our victory is assured!
