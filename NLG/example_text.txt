{The glory of God} has smiled upon our armies yet again. Word has reached from the {Siam} front
that our glorious army has completely destroyed the enemy forces in Indonesia. Those cowardly {germans}
must be crying to their mothers after losing such an important strategic position!
But that's not all! Our brilliant strategists knew of the great power the {english} people have and
pressed on into Western Australia and we beat them there as well! The weakling enemy had no defense
against our brave soldiers. The third batallion waltzed right in and took not only Western Australia, but
Eastern Australia as well! It is only a matter of time before those {german} cockroaches surrender to
our overpowering might!
